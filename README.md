# sortable-list-coding-challenge
Angular.js coding challenge done entirely in 24hs

I had to follow these rules:

Your task is simply to build a sortable list of items. The following are the requirements:

1. Each item in the list consists of a textual description up to 25 chars.

2. The user must be able to Add, Remove, and Edit items in the list.

3. The list must be sortable via drag and drop.

4. This must be a one page application built using HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript.

..a. No back end. No server deployment.

..b. Build tools are allowed. E.g. webpack, gulp, grunt.

5. The list must be persisted to IndexedDB or WebSQL.

..a. No Save button. All actions must persist automatically - Add, Delete, Edit, Move.

..b. Include a Clear button that wipes out all the data, for testing purposes.

6. Use good coding practices

..a. Structure your folders and files consistently

..b. No inline styles

..c. Format your code properly

..d. Include comments where they will be helpful

..e. Itâ€™s recommended to follow this ES2015 Angular style guide: https://github.com/toddmotto/angular-styleguide

7. You do not have to write this from scratch. Use any freely available libraries or code snippets you wish (include citations where necessary).

8. While an elaborate graphical design is not necessary, you should still make your page look nice.

9. Make use of the new component helper method from Angular 1.5 to create an isolated component with a clear interface through its bindings property. (https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/component)

10. This will be tested in Chrome so it's possible to use ES6/ES2015 without transpiling (Typescript or Babel are allowed too). Support of other browsers is optional.

11. All of this must be done in 24hs or less.
